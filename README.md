## Usage

If you're on MacOS, you can open the Terminal application, and navigate to the root directory of this project using the cd command. Once you are in the root directory, you can type the following command.

    % python app.py

The command "python app.py" executes the Python program. The module "app.py" is the main module of the project. You can also think of it as the entry point. It starts a web server on port 5000.

After you type the command "python app.py", you can open the URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" in a web browser, and you should see the HTML content of the index page.

You can write an expression into the text field, and click on the evaluate button to get an answer.

This is all a little long-winded, so let's write it down as a series of steps.

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project
2. Run the command "python app.py" from the root directory of the project
3. Open the URL "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" in a web browser
4. Type any expression into the text field, like (2+3)^3 + 75, and click on the Evaluate button to see the result

This project uses the Flask framework, and we can talk more later on about how to use Flask. I am going to take a short break and when I get back we can talk about Flask.
